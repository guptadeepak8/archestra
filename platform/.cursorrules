# Cursor Rules for Archestra Platform

## Working Directory
ALWAYS run all commands from the `platform/` directory unless specifically instructed otherwise.

## Important Rules
1. ALWAYS use pnpm (not npm or yarn) for package management
2. Use Biome for formatting and linting - Run `pnpm lint` before committing changes
3. TypeScript strict mode - Ensure code passes `pnpm type-check` before completion
4. Use shadcn/ui components - Add components with `npx shadcn@latest add <component>` instead of using Radix UI directly

## Tech Stack
- Monorepo: pnpm workspaces with Turbo
- Backend: Fastify + Drizzle ORM (PostgreSQL)
- Frontend: Next.js 15.5.4 + React 19 + Turbopack + Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui
- Code Quality: Biome for linting and formatting
- Testing: Vitest with PGLite

## Development Best Practices
- Use existing patterns and libraries - check neighboring files for examples
- Follow existing naming conventions (camelCase for TypeScript)
- Test files should be colocated with source (`.test.ts` extension)
- Use workspace-relative imports within each workspace
- Run `pnpm type-check` before committing to catch type errors
